# TDDD23 game project plan [Unknown]

## Game idea

2D spaceship carnage with constand rolling screen (Ikaruga). Lots of enemies 

flying and shooting in given patters. Either level based or continous. 

## Game tech

- Unity
- Pixelmator
- Github
- (DB for leaderbords)

## Progression in the game

- Powerups from drops or uppgrade menu between ”levels”
- Increased speed 
- More/stronger enemies
- Bosses

## In-game tutoring approach

- Tutoring in the menu, use the ship to navigate in the menu. 
- If we use powerups drop they will have a clear purpose-design
