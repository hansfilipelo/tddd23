# TDDD23 game project plan [Unknown]

## Game idea

2D spaceship carnage with constant rolling screen, [Ikaruga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIxKjmrCrS4) like. Lots of enemies flying and shooting in given patters. Either level based or continous. 

## Game tech

- Unity game engine
- Pixelmator for creating artwork
- Git and Github for source control
- XBox 360 Controller support
- Possibly SQLite as DB for leaderbords

## Progression in the game

- Powerups from drops that occour in-game or choisese to uppgrade using a menu that appear between ”levels”
- Increased speed 
- More/stronger enemies
- Bosses 

## In-game tutoring approach

The in-game tutoring will start right off with the main menus design. We are thinking that the menu chooser consists of a spaceship as selector, which fires it's weapon when the player makes a choise. 

From that moment on we plan on introducing new types of enemies slowly - so that a player knows how to handle a certain enemy type before we throw hundreds of them at the player. 

### Powerups

If we use powerups drop they will have a clear purpose-design. Weapon upgrades will look in a certain way (maybe like an arrow), armor upgrades in another (maybe like a shield).
